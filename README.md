Overview
--------

### Files
`proximity_anomaly`
	Generates Anomaly Report Email
`proximity_config`

`proximity_initdb`

### Setup
The setup is really up to the user.  Generally, what I have found to be the best method is one server with a public IP which collects data and one that does the processing.  The data from the collecting server gets rsynced off to the other.  I've attached under ~/misc some of the modified system files.  I use snort for capturing because of the build in packet logging.  TCPDump / NGREP / TCPFlow / etc. all work as well. 

### Installation
 1. Install System Packages, Modules, and Software
 2. Configure `proximity_config` with needed details
 3. Execute `proximity_initdb`
