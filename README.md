=========

Sinkhole Operational Framework for Automation and Reporting

Proximity is a post-processer for PCAP data obtained from a malware sinkhole.  The key purpose is to sort and report on data collected.  The server component works by checking a folder on a regular basis for new PCAP files.  For each new file, every connection is logged to a backend database for storage and searching.  

The connections are each processed over a set of analyst written filters that will attempt to match the connection based on known malware patterns.   Proximity will also attempt to extract any Meta data such as HTTP Host headers and connection details and will store those in the database  for faster searching.





Overview
--------

#### Files

 * proximity_core : The Core of the Proximity Framework
 * proximity_controller : Tool for interfacing with the database (Add, Remove, List Filters)
 * proximity_reporter : Generate Reports, Pull Data, Search the DataBase
 * proximity_anomaly : Generate Anomaly Report Emails
 * proximity_config : Configuration File
 * proximity_initdb : Create the database scheme (and wipe it)

#### Setup
The setup is really up to the user.  Generally, what I have found to be the best method is one server with a public IP which collects data and one that does the processing.  The data from the collecting server gets rsynced off to the other.  I've attached under ~/misc some of the modified system files.  I use snort for capturing because of the build in packet logging.  TCPDump / NGREP / TCPFlow / etc. all work as well. 

#### Installation
 1. Install System Packages, Modules, and Software
 2. Configure `proximity_config` with needed details
 3. Execute `proximity_initdb` Please note that you *DO NOT* need to pre-configure your Database and User. This will do that for you. Just make sure you set the right values in the config before running this script.
